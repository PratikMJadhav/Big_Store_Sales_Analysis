##ðŸ”‘ Key Insights
1. Top Performing Region
- West is dominating sales with 63.81% of total sales, followed by East (20.2%).
- Central and South regions contribute very little â€” an opportunity to improve market penetration or revisit sales strategy.

2. Sales vs Profit Discrepancy
- December has the highest sales (15K), but profit is relatively low (~0.5K).
- March and May show relatively low sales but higher profit (especially March with 7.4K) â€” this suggests high-margin sales happened in these months.

3. Customer Segment Performance
- Consumers contribute nearly 50% of sales, followed by Corporate (35%).
- Home Office lags behind â€” consider targeted marketing or bundling offers for this segment.

4. Payment Mode
Cash on Delivery (COD) is the most popular payment method at 49.32%, which may imply trust issues or logistics barriers with prepaid options.

5. Product Category Breakdown
- Office Supplies (36K) lead in sales, followed by Furniture (26K) and Technology.
- Top sub-categories: Phones, Chairs, Binders â€” maybe focus promotions or cross-sell in these areas.

6. Shipping Preferences
- Standard Class (47K) is preferred, followed by First Class and Second Class.
- Same Day delivery has very low adoption â€” could be improved with incentives if profitable.

7. Delivery Metrics
Total Delivery Days: 88, with 1.0 avg. delivery day â€” implies very fast shipping, which is excellent for customer satisfaction.

8. Geographical Focus
Map shows highest activity on the West Coast and major cities â€” potential to grow in underperforming states (e.g., Central U.S.).

##ðŸ§  Strategic Recommendations
â€¢ Focus on profitability: Boost low-margin months (like December) with better product mix or pricing strategy.

â€¢ Grow underperforming regions: Target Central and South with geo-specific campaigns.

â€¢ Diversify shipping modes: Educate users or provide perks to shift some volume to Same Day if logistics allow.

â€¢ Strengthen Online Payment: Explore why COD dominates â€” possibly trust issues or lack of digital options.

â€¢ Product Expansion: Phones and Chairs perform well â€” consider expanding SKUs or accessories in these sub-categories.
